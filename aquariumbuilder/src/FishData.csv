1,Betta,"An easygoing but often mistreated fish. They come in a variety of colours and fin types with the most common being the Crowntail. They are hardy fish that can breathe air which is why many people put them in tiny aquariums, but they still need a suitable home. Their aquarium should be no smaller than 2.5 gallons. Despite their names as fighting fish, they get along with most other fish. Male bettas should never be in the same aquarium with each other as they become territorial and will fight each other. You should also be careful about having colourful fish with male bettas because they might mistake them for another male betta. Bettas also don?t get along with any type of gourami. It seems like there?s a lot of concerns that come with bettas, but they are an excellent addition to any aquarium. Like people, every betta has its own temperament so some might attack every fish sharing the aquarium with them or they might even avoid all of them. It?s important to always observe your betta and be ready if things don?t work out.",Semi-Aggressive,0,1,75,86,6.8,7.4,,3,2.5
2,Angelfish,"A beautiful fish with a bit of a temper towards its own kind much like bettas. They can get quite large, so they?ll need at least a 20 gallon aquarium with taller aquariums being more preferable. Angelfish get along with most other fish but the issue comes when they pair off into couples and become territorial. If the space is big enough, there isn?t much worry since the angelfish will just try to dissuade other angelfish from entering its territory.  ",Peaceful,0,0,75,82,6.5,7.5,,6,2.5
3,Platy,"Platies are a hardy species of livebearers that give birth to live young. There are many colours to choose from to provide you with lots of variety. Much like guppies, if there are at least one male and female in the aquarium, there WILL be babies. If that’s what you want, then make sure there are plenty of plants and hiding places for the babies to hide from their parents and other fish that will try to eat them. Males will constantly chase the female trying to breed with them so to prevent females from being stressed, there should be more females than males.",Peaceful,0,0,72,75,6.8,8,,3,2.5
4,Guppy,"Guppies are tiny but lively livebearer fish that add bright colours to any aquarium. Males tend to be smaller but with more colour than the females. They multiply incredibly quickly if there is at least one male and female. Guppies aren’t as hardy as they used to be because of how often they are bred but if you provide them with a suitable habitat, they will thrive. Avoid keeping them with fish that may nip at fins because the long flowy tails of guppies make them an easy target",Peaceful,0,0,75,82,6,8,,2.4,2.5
5,Cardinal Tetra,"Although similar looking to neon tetras, cardinal tetras are a little bigger and have a more prominent red colouration. Since they’re essentially just bigger neon tetras, why not just get neon tetras? Well cardinal tetras are hardier than neon tetras since they haven’t been overbred to the point where most of the species are weak. While most people might recommend neon tetras for beginners, cardinal tetras may be a better choice since you can still get the beautiful colouration but with a fish that will be more tolerant of water conditions",Peaceful,6,0,73,81,6,7,,2,2.5
6,Dwarf Gourami,"Dwarf gouramis are popular cousins to the betta since they too can breathe when they choose to. They also have two fins that look like antennae which they use to feel around the floor to find food or navigate the shallow muddy waters of the wild habitat they come from. Unfortunately, they are prone to a viral infection specific to this species of fish which is untreatable. If you keep your water conditions good and stable, it should not be a problem. Males can be territorial much like bettas so be careful when deciding to house more than one male gouramis together.",Peaceful,0,2,72,82,6,7.5,,2,20
7,Bristlenose Pleco,"A small and great fish for helping clean algae in your aquarium. They are distinct because of bristles that grow on their head which is even more prominent with males. You can constantly see them sticking to the glass or on logs in the tank, scraping away algae. Although, just relying on algae isn’t enough, you should supplement them with algae wafers to make sure they don’t go hungry. Be mindful if you decide to keep more than one male together because they might become territorial and fight each other",Peaceful,0,1,73,81,6.5,7.5,,5,2.5
8,Tiger Barb,"Visually striking fish with colours as energetic as they are. While not as vicious as tigers, tiger barbs are known to chase or nip at the fins of slower fish and those with long flowing fins. They should be kept in a school of at least 6 as they will spend more time chasing each other around rather than their tankmates which helps deal with aggression. Try to avoid keeping them with other semi-aggressive fish to prevent the chance of fish being injured",Semi-Aggressive,6,0,77,82,6,8,,3,2.5
9,Panda Corydora,"Cute little bottom-feeding catfish that will help keep the bottom of your tank clear of leftover food. Using their “whiskers”, Corydoras use it to find food in the substrate. These barbells are sensitive and it is recommended the bottom of your tank is covered in sand or smooth rocks to prevent damaging these barbells. They should still be fed their own food like sinking pellets or bloodworms because leftovers alone won’t be enough.",Peaceful,6,0,68,77,6,7,,2,2.5
10,Harlequin Rasbora,,Peaceful,6,0,72,81,6,7.8,,2,2.5
11,Kuhli Loach,Kuhli loaches are eel-like bottom-feeders that are great for cleaning leftover food on the bottom of the tank but still require their own food to stay healthy. They lack scales like most fish so it would be helpful to have either sand or smooth rock substrate to not damage their skin. They are typically nocturnal so don’t expect too much activity from them during the day,Peaceful,6,0,73,86,5.5,6.5,,4,2.5
12,Rainbow Shark,"Rainbow sharks are vibrant fish that unfortunately are a little territorial. As a result, you shouldn’t have more than one in your aquarium and you should have plenty of space and hiding spots to reduce the chance for your rainbow shark to be aggressive to its tankmates. Despite their name, these fish are bottom feeders and will eat leftover food off the ground but would appreciate having their own food for them like sinking pellets.",Semi-Aggressive,0,1,72,82,6.5,7.5,,6,2.5
13,Neon Tetra,"Neon tetras are perhaps one of the most popular tropical fish in the hobby and it’s easy to see why with their striking red and blue pattern that looks incredible when a school of them swim together. Because of their popularity though, they’ve been bred extensively and as a result of this and inbreeding, they have become a very vulnerable species. It isn’t uncommon to see neon tetras fall ill to disease and parasites so you should be wary. However, they are still an excellent addition to your aquarium as long as you closely monitor their water conditions.",Peaceful,6,0,70,81,6,7,,1.5,2.5
